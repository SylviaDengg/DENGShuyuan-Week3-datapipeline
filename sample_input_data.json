      "title": "Attack on Ilhan Omar Follows Years of Trump’s Targeting Her",
      "content": "As President Trump riled up a rally crowd on Tuesday night describing immigrants bent on harming and killing Americans, he singled out one person in particular as an example of a bad actor. Foreigners coming into the United States, he told his audience in Iowa, “have to show they can love our country; they have to be proud — not like Ilhan Omar.” The crowd booed. They recognized the name of the Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, whom the president has demonized and dehumanized for years with racist and xenophobic attacks, venting that she should “go back” to her country, referring to her as “garbage,” and mocking her hijab by calling it a “little turban.” Not long afterward, at her own event in North Minneapolis, Ms. Omar wasattacked by a man who rushed the lecternwhere she was speaking, spraying her with a strong-smelling liquid. The scene, which unfolded as Ms. Omar was calling for the resignation of Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary who has carried out Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown, was shocking but hardly surprising.

      "title": "America at a Boiling Point: Deaths, Threats, Protests and a Town Hall Attack",
      "content": "The battle for Minneapolis and the killings of two American citizens by federal agents have freshly exposed the dangerous degree to which the nation’s social fabric has frayed, the latest smudging of an already thin line between politics and violence in America. Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, became the latest target of violence directed at lawmakers on Tuesday evening, when a man charged her at a town hall and used a syringe to spray her with a liquid that smelled like vinegar before he was tackled by security. That same night the United States Capitol Police releaseda disturbing reportshowing a surge in threat cases against lawmakers, their families and staff members: They spiked to a staggering 14,938 last year, up from 9,474 in 2024. Earlier in the day, President Trump had traveled to neighboring Iowa, talking up efforts to “de-escalate a little bit” on Fox News. But he targeted Ms. Omar just hours before she was attacked and stoked the darkest fears about immigrants, warning a crowd of supporters they would “blow up our shopping centers, blow up our farms, kill people.” “Hardened, vicious, horrible criminals,” Mr. Trump said, vilifying those who have been arrested. There is a new normalcy to political violence in America, a numbing rhythm to the repeated denunciations after whatever happens to be the latest incident: theassassination of Charlie Kirk;the firebombing of Gov. Josh Shapiro’s homein Pennsylvania;the attack on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband;the shooting of Representative Steve Scaliseat a congressional baseball practice. Representative Jared Golden of Maine, a Democrat,announced he was retiringfrom Congress last year in part because of rising threats to his family. He is 43 and a former Marine.

      "title": "Trump and Schumer Move Toward Possible Deal to Avert a Shutdown",
      "content": "President Trump and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, moved on Wednesday night toward a possible agreement to negotiate new restrictions on federal immigration agents, potentially averting a government shutdown early Saturday when funding for multiple federal agencies is slated to lapse. Under the emerging plan, according to two officials knowledgeable about it, the Senate would split off legislation funding the Department of Homeland Security from a six-bill package of spending measures needed to keep the military, health programs and other federal agencies funded for the remainder of the fiscal year. The Senate would pass those bills before a Friday midnight deadline, and Congress also would consider a short-term extension for homeland security operations, which would prevent an interruption of services by the Transportation Security Agency, Coast Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency. That stopgap bill would provide time for talks between lawmakers and the White House to draft a new homeland security spending bill that would include new restrictions that Democrats have demanded on the tactics of immigration enforcement officers and more accountability for those accused of using excessive force. The White House had no immediate comment on the possible deal. Officials emphasized that the agreement was not sealed and multiple hurdles remained. But the progress toward a potential offramp from the shutdown showdown came, according to the officials, after Senate Democrats earlier on Wednesday hadlaid out the changes they insisted must be madein the Trump administration’s conduct of its immigration crackdown before they would support continued funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Among the demands from Democrats was that federal agents carrying out Mr. Trump’s deportation campaign take off their masks, wear body cameras and halt random sweeps and warrantless searches and arrests. Mr. Schumer had pushed Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader, to break up the six-bill package and allow a rewriting of the homeland security legislation after Saturday’s fatal shooting in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti. Mr. Thune had resisted but also encouraged Mr. Schumer to seek a deal with the administration. It was unclear how the potential agreement would impact a test vote on the spending package set for Thursday morning. It also came as Tom Homan, the border czar dispatched by Mr. Trump to try to quiet the tumult in Minneapolis, was to hold a news conference Thursday morning. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said the two sides were moving toward a resolution of the crisis. “It appears that the White House and the Senate are making good progress to avoid a shutdown,” she said.

      "title": "Nervous Allies and Fox News: How Trump Realized He Had a Big Problem in Minneapolis",
      "content": "The crisis in Minneapolis was not dying down. The government’s account of the killing on Saturday of Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, was unraveling. Stephen Miller, the mastermind of President Trump’s hard-line immigration policy, had called Mr. Pretti a “terrorist” and told other administration officials, including Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, to call him an “assassin.” Butvideos clearly contradicted that story. Mr. Pretti was pinned down when immigration agents opened fire and killed him. Protests and a palpable sense of outrage were growing across the country. Even thepresident’s allieswere alarmed. Many of them wanted to see changes on the ground, and several made a recommendation directly in calls to the president: Send Tom Homan, the White House border czar, to Minneapolis. Early Monday, Brian Kilmeade, the co-host of “Fox & Friends,” of which Mr. Trump is a loyal viewer, repeated the message three times in two hours. Twenty minutes later, the president announced on social media that he was sending Mr. Homan to Minneapolis, a tacit acknowledgment that he was losing control of a situation that posed one of the most serious political threats of his second administration. Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official who had been directing on-the-ground operations in Minneapolis, and who was known for aggressive tactics, was out. “Bovino is pretty good, but he’s a pretty out-there kind of guy,” Mr. Trump told Fox News. “Maybe it wasn’t good here.” And while there is no sign that Mr. Trump is repudiating the tactics used by the federal agents in Minnesota or the core tenets of his immigration policies, the moment was a rare example of the president moving to mitigate the harsh optics associated with a crackdown his administration has otherwise celebrated.

      "title": "Videos Show Alex Pretti in Confrontation With Agents 11 Days Before His Death",
      "content": "The nurse who was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday was pushed to the ground by different agents at a protest 11 days before he was killed, according to newly unearthed videos that show him spitting and cursing at them and kicking a taillight on one of their S.U.V.s. The footage adds to what is known about the 37-year-old nurse, Alex Pretti, who was killed by federal agents on Saturday morning after they pepper sprayed him and pushed him and a woman to the ground, a killing that set off protests in the Twin Cities and across the country. In the earlier incident, on Jan. 13, Mr. Pretti — wearing some of the same clothing as when he was killed — can be seen running toward a street corner in the South Minneapolis neighborhood of Powderhorn where a crowd of protesters have gathered and are jeering at federal agents. “What are you doing here?” he shouts at agents who are standing next to two of their S.U.V.s. He repeatedly curses at them and spits at one agent as the agent is getting into a vehicle. When the agents begin to drive away, Mr. Pretti kicks twice at one of the vehicle’s taillights, breaking it. That seems to prompt the agents to get back out of the vehicle and push him to the ground. The agents, at least some of whom are with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, hold Mr. Pretti on the ground for about 20 seconds before letting him go and driving off.

      "title": "Rubio Says Venezuela Will Submit Monthly Budget to White House",
      "content": "Venezuela’s interim government has agreed to submit a monthly “budget” to the Trump administration, which will release money from an account funded by the country’s oil sales and initially managed by Qatar, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday. But the plan drew sharp questions from skeptical Democrats, and Mr. Rubio conceded that it was “novel” and hastily designed. The role of Qatar — a Middle Eastern country thousands of miles from Venezuela whose ruler has won President Trump’s favor — drew particular criticism from Democrats, who questioned its legality and transparency. Mr. Rubio detailed the plan during an appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It was Mr. Rubio’s first public testimony to Congress since American forces captured Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3, and an opportunity to clarify U.S. policy toward the country. Many questions are sure to persist, however. Mr. Rubio assured senators, for instance, that the Trump administration had established a “very respectful and productive line of communication” with the government of Delcy Rodríguez, a close ally of Mr. Maduro who assumed power after his removal. As a result, he said, the Trump administration does not “intend or expect” to use military force against Venezuela “at any time.” Yet Mr. Rubio took a more threatening tone in a written opening statement that he submitted to the committee but did not deliver orally, making brief extemporaneous remarks instead. The written statement warned that the United States was “prepared to use force to ensure maximum cooperation” from Ms. Rodríguez’s government “if other methods fail.” That cooperation is largely focused on Venezuela’s lucrative oil industry. Mr. Trump has previously said that the United States will control Venezuela’s oil and “run the country,” but Mr. Rubio provided more details. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

      "title": "Trump Threatens Iran With ‘Massive Armada’ and Presses a Set of Demands",
      "content": "President Trump sharply intensified his threats against Iran on Wednesday, suggesting that if it did not agree to a set of demands the administration had made of the country’s leaders, he could soon mount an attack “with speed and violence.” Mr. Trump’s threat of a second direct attack on Iran by U.S. forces in eight months came as the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, along with other naval ships, bombers and fighter jets, took up positions in the region in striking distance of the country. Mr. Trump explicitly compared the buildup to the forces he amassed near Venezuela late last year, just ahead of the operation that seized Nicolás Maduro and his wife in the middle of the night early in January. Mr. Trump gave no specifics about the deal he was demanding, saying only that a “massive Armada” was heading toward Iran and that the country should make a deal. But U.S. and European officials say that in talks, they have put three demands in front of the Iranians: a permanent end to all enrichment of uranium and disposal of its current stockpiles, limits on the range and number of their ballistic missiles, and an end to all support for proxy groups in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis operating in Yemen. Notably absent from those demands — and from Mr. Trump’s post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning — was any reference to protecting the protesters who took to the streets in Iran in December, convulsing the country and creating the latest crisis for its government. Mr. Trump had promised, in past social media posts, to come to their aid, but has barely mentioned them in recent weeks. Iran says the death toll was 3,117, but human rights groups say that figure vastly underestimates the actual number killed. Their figures range from 3,400 to 6,200, but they say that once internet blackouts are lifted, the numbers will likely rise significantly. Mr. Trump has felt emboldened since the initial success in Venezuela, and he was clearly using the threat of a similar decapitation of the Iranian regime in an effort to intimidate the country’s clerical leadership and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, its most elite military forces.

      "title": "Man Sentenced to 15 Years for Role in Plot to Kill Iranian Dissident",
      "content": "A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday sentenced a man to 15 years in prison for his role in a plot to kill an Iranian dissident in 2024, another case in which the Iranian government’s global campaign to silence opponents has extended to the United States. Carlisle Rivera, a self-employed Brooklyn pipe fitter, became the third person to be sentenced for playing a role in trying to killMasih Alinejad, an activist and a critic of the Iranian government. Before being sentenced, Mr. Rivera apologized to “my fellow Americans” and to Ms. Alinejad, who was in court. Ms. Alinejad also spoke on Wednesday, at times looking directly at Mr. Rivera, who gazed back at her while seated in the well of the courtroom, dressed in a tan jail uniform. While expressing bewilderment that Mr. Rivera would agree to kill a stranger, Ms. Alinejad castigated the Iranianauthoritieswho prosecutors said had initiated multiple plots against her. U.S. officials have said that the Iranian government has been focused for years on silencing Ms. Alinejad, who was born in Iran and worked there as a journalist before moving to the United States. The Iranian government has tried to silence critics both at home and abroad. Those efforts have more recently included plots inside the United States where prosecutors have said that figures in Iran have hired criminals — including Russian mobsters, Mexican cartel hit men and a Canadian Hells Angel — to carry out violent acts. “Today’s sentence should be a warning to anyone who would cast their lot with the brutal Iranian regime and seek to do their murderous bidding, especially on American soil,” said Jay Clayton, the Southern District’s U.S. attorney, in a statement. Mr. Rivera’s sentencing comes as the Iranian government has beensquashing protests in Tehran and elsewhere that started to spring up about a month ago, prompted by the government’s management of the economy. As demonstrations grew, Iranian leaders shut off theinternetand arrested dissidents, leading to wider unrest. The government responded by killing thousands, effectively ending theuprising.
